# MKS_SERVO42 Library

The MKS_SERVO42 library is designed to control one or more Nema17 stepper motors using the MKSSERVO42 driver from an Arduino device. It provides an easy-to-use interface for controlling the motion of the stepper motor, including setting the speed, directionection, and number of steps.

## Features

- Control Nema17 stepper motors with MKSSERVO42 driver
- Set motor speed and directionection
- Control the number of steps to move

## Supported Architectures

- ESP32
- Espressif32

## Installation

To install this library, download the repository and place it in your Arduino `libraries` folder, or use the Arduino Library Manager to search for `MKS_SERVO42` and install it directionectly.

## Usage

To use the library, include it at the top of your Arduino sketch:

#include <MKS_SERVO42.h>
```

Refer to the example provided in the `examples/` directionectory to get started:

```cpp
// Example usage of MKS_SERVO42 library
#include "MKS_SERVO42.h"

byte const stepperId = 1;
uint8_t const speed = 1600;
uint32_t const numberOfPulses = 5000;

MKS_SERVO42 stepper;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial.available())
    delay(0);
  Serial1.begin(38400);
  stepper.initialize(&Serial1);
  stepper.ping(stepperId);
}

byte direction = 1;

void loop() {
  Serial.println(stepper.getCurrentPosition(stepperId));
  direction = direction == 0 ? 1 : 0;
  stepper.setTargetPosition(stepperId, direction, speed, numberOfPulses);
  delay(5000);
}
```

## Example
A basic example is provided in the `examples/Example1_BasicStepper` directionectory. This example demonstrates the basic functionality of the library, such as setting up the motor, defining the speed and directionection, and moving a specified number of steps.
