# MKS_SERVO42 Library

The MKS_SERVO42 library is designed to control one or more Nema23 stepper motors using the MKSSERVO57 driver from an Arduino device. It provides an easy-to-use interface for controlling the motion of the stepper motor, including setting the speed, direction, and number of steps.

## Features

- Control Nema23 stepper motors with MKSSERVO57 driver
- Set motor speed and direction
- Control the number of steps to move

## Supported Architectures

- ESP32
- Espressif32

## Installation

To install this library, download the repository and place it in your Arduino `libraries` folder, or use the Arduino Library Manager to search for `MKS_SERVO42` and install it directly.

## Usage

To use the library, include it at the top of your Arduino sketch:

#include <MKS_SERVO42.h>
```

Refer to the example provided in the `examples/` directory to get started:

```cpp
// Example usage of MKS_SERVO42 library
#include <MKS_SERVO42.h>

MKS_SERVO42 stepper;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial.available())
    delay(10);
  Serial1.begin(38400, SERIAL_8N1, D9, D8, false, 5000);
  stepper.initialize(&Serial1);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println(stepper.setTargetPosition(1, 1, 1600, 15, 10000));
  delay(2000);
  Serial.println(stepper.setTargetPosition(1, 0, 1600, 15, 10000));
  delay(2000);
}
```

## Example
A basic example is provided in the `examples/Example1_BasicStepper` directory. This example demonstrates the basic functionality of the library, such as setting up the motor, defining the speed and direction, and moving a specified number of steps.
